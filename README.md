# Keras Tutorial

This repo contains materials to support a three-hour introductory workshop on building deep learning models with Keras and TensorFlow. For more samples, an engineering blog, and extended discussion, I sincerely recommend checking out the [Keras website](https://keras.io/), as well as Francois Chollet's phenomenal book, [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python).

### HOUR 1: THEORY
* What is deep learning, and why should you care?
* What is TensorFlow, and why can it be a pain to use?
* What is Keras?

### HOUR 2: GETTING STARTED WITH TENSORFLOW
* Building a neural network, from nuts to bolts

### HOUR 3: GETTING STARTED WITH KERAS
