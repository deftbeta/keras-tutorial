# Keras Tutorial

This repo contains materials to support a three-hour introductory workshop on building deep learning models with Keras and TensorFlow. For more samples, an engineering blog, and extended discussion, I sincerely recommend checking out the [Keras website](https://keras.io/), as well as Francois Chollet's phenomenal book, [_Deep Learning with Python_](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python).

### HOUR 1: THEORY
* What is deep learning, and why should you care?
* What is TensorFlow, and why can it be a pain to use?
* What is Keras?

### HOUR 2: GETTING STARTED WITH FEEDFORWARD NEURAL NETWORKS
* Building a neural network in `numpy`, from nuts to bolts
* Incorporating back propagation
* Interpolating values for hidden nodes

### HOUR 3: GETTING STARTED WITH KERAS
* Specifying the model (`Sequential()`, `.add()`-ing layers)
* Compiling the model (`.compile()`, adding optimizers, understanding `loss`)
* Fitting the model (`.fit()` with predictors and targets)
* Optimizing the model (changing architectures - nodes, layers)
